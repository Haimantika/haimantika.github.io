      <description>DevRelCon Yokohama was all about meeting amazing people, a lot of learnings, some &amp;ldquo;this is my first time doing it&amp;rdquo; and a lot of FUN!
This was my first time speaking in a in-person international conference, I was excited and nervous at the same time. It was a two day conference, happening in Yokohama, Japan. I have been friends with the DevRelCon Tokyo/Yokohama organising team since 2020, I was a speaker for the online edition (also a major reason why I chose my career in DevRel).</description>

      <description>Hi ðŸ‘‹ Haimantika here! We finally have a portfolio, where you get to find everything about me in one place.
For those who are new here, hi! I am Haimantika, a Developer Advocate at Appwrite and used to work at Microsoft for a short stint as a Support Engineer.
I come from a small city, Siliguri located in the North Eastern part of India. Fun fact - I never wanted to do engineering, fast forward to 6 years, now I have an engineering degree and working full-time in tech for 2 years.</description>

      <title>What is DevRel?</title>

      <description>DevRels are making the heads turn and if you think it&amp;rsquo;s because the job is cool, you are mistaken. It is because the term is relatively new and many are unaware of the role.
If I had to express that in a tweet, it would go something like ðŸ‘‡
P.S - The definition of DevRel has a lot to do with individual perspectives and company goals. In this article I will try to put a generalised view of the role.</description>
