      <description>Hi ðŸ‘‹ Haimantika here! We finally have a portfolio, where you get to find everything about me in one place.
For those who are new here, hi! I am Haimantika, a Developer Advocate at Appwrite and used to work at Microsoft for a short stint as a Support Engineer.
I come from a small city, Siliguri located in the North Eastern part of India. Fun fact - I never wanted to do engineering, fast forward to 6 years, now I have an engineering degree and working full-time in tech for 2 years.</description>
