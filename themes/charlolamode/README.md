## Quick Start

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


**Open your terminal or command line**

1. Create a new folder 'quickstart'

```console
hugo new site quickstart
```

2. Go into this folder 
```console
cd quickstart
```

3. Initialize an empty Git repository in the current directory
```console
git init
```

4. Clone this repository into your folder
```console
git submodule add https://github.com/charlola/hugo-theme-charlolamode.git themes/charlolamode
```

5. Delete the config.toml
```console
rm config.toml
```

6. Add theme in a new config.yml file
```console
echo "theme: charlolamode" >> config.yml
```

7. Start Hugo's development server to view the site locally.
```console
hugo server
```

Once the local server starts, you can see your site. If your webbrowser does not automatically pop up, open your browser and enter http://localhost:1313. Now you can start to modify this page in the directory. If you save new changes, this site will automatically refresh and render the modification.


## Open Visual Studio Code to edit your Blog

3. Open your favorite Editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
### Basic Configuration

The config.yml is your best friend. You can modify and add information, such as ...
- Title of the page
- Your Name
- Description
- Social Icons
- Buttons

Have a look at the charlolamode/config.yml for reference. There are commented examples which show you how to easily add tabs and social icons like LinkedIn, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram. Copy the content in your config.yml which will overwrite the config.yml of the theme.

### Change Profile Image

To add your profile pic, replace ***profile.png*** in the folder ***static/images***. Make sure you take an image with a happy face :)

### Add tabs

In the config.yml you can add new tabs next to 'Articles' and 'Contact'. Uncomment 'Category' to check it out.

***Note***
If you add a new tab in the config.yml, you have to do the following:
1. Add new folder in the directory 'content' with the ***same name*** as the new tab.
2. Copy ***_index.md*** from articles into new folder.

### Add new content

If you like to push new content, create a new Markdown file in the new folder. Find an example in ***content/articles/article.md***.


### Change colors

Have a look at assets/css/core/theme-vars.css to play around with colors.

### Disable 'Profile Mode'

To display Article content on the home page, rather than profile information, set the following under params: in ***config.yml***
```
profileMode: 
    enabled: false
```

With the Article content moved to the home page, removing the main menu entry for ***Articles*** may be desirable:
```
menu:
    main:
        - name: Contact
          url: contact/
          weight: 30
        # - name: Articles
        #   url: articles/
        #   weight: 20
        - name: Projects
          url: projects
          weight: 15
```
